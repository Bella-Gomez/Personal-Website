                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>Hello! My name is Isabella Gomez, and I will graduate from Fresno High School in 2023. In addition to
                    high school, I am attending CART (Center of Advanced Research and Technology) to learn more about
                    possible career paths. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Application Development lab, but I'll be in
                    CART's Interactive Game Design Lab next year. In terms of a career, I'd like to be a concept artist
                    or work in the arts or programming.
                </p>

                <p>Drawing, listening to music, and casual gaming are some of my favorite pastimes. I usually draw in my
                    sketchbook, but I also draw digitally on my computer or phone. I listen to music a lot, whether I'm
                    drawing or just walking to class. I prefer hard rock, indie rock, indie R&B, pop, and video game
                    remixes, but I am open to listening to anything. Ghost b.c., Glass Animal, and Oingo Boingo are
                    three of my favorite bands/artists. Because I don't have many games, I play them more casually than
                    others, but my favorites to play are The Long Dark, Hollow Knight, and Minecraft. I'm hoping to play
                    more frequently once I've expanded my inventory.
                </p>

                <p>I have a few other pages in my portfolio, including a work page and a contact page, so please take a
                    look at the rest of my portfolio to learn more about me and my work. :)

                <h1>Awards and achievements</h1>

                <p>Honor roll and principal awards were among my accomplishments from freshman to junior year. With a
                    GPA of 3.00 or higher, I was named to the honor roll. And I received a principal award for
                    consistently maintaining a 4.00 GPA. Earning the principal award was cool because it comes with some
                    letterman patches. :)

                <h1> post-secondary plan </h1>

                <p> I don't have much of a secondary plan as of yet. But, for the time being, I intend to begin working
                    when I am in my senior year or later. I envision myself attending college and living in an apartment
                    or dorm with a roommate(s). </p>

                <p> In terms of education, I intend to continue at Fresno High School and CART moving on to the
                    Interactive Game Design Lab. After graduating and completing the lab, I intend to attend college and
                    pursue a graphic design degree.
