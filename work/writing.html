                <h2>Tourism copy text</h2>

                <p>
                    My first large group coding project was to create a website for a tourism agency, for which we wrote
                    about Russia, Canada, and Germany. We coded the project for this website in Visual Studio using HTML
                    and CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We were required to create a homepage as well as a destination. Each destination has a about,
                    discover, and visit section. The content for the about section should include general information
                    about the location, the discovery section should highlight cultural traditions or activities, and
                    the visit section should detail travel options to that destination. The HTML must be valid and pass
                    the W3C HTML/CSS validation. Using CSS media queries, the website should also be able to display on
                    any screen type, from desktop to phone.
                </p>

                <h2>Chronoshift copy text</h2>

                <p>My first proper coding project was creating a website for ChronoShift, a futuristic company that
                    traveled back in time to hunt any animal. We used HTML and CSS in Visual Studio to code the project
                    for this website.</p>

                <p>We had to create five pages for this website. Each content page should include enough writing to
                    fully and clearly communicate the necessary information while also including supporting images. We
                    had to use flexbox for programming, which we had only recently learned about.</p>

                <h2>About me copy text</h2>

                <p>My first website had a 'About Me' page where I told my teachers and classmates about myself. Adobe
                    Express was used to create the website's pages (formerly Adobe Spark). We had to design the
                    website's
                    homepage and about page, which included information such as family and friends, hobbies, travels,
                    future
                    plans, and contact information.</p>

                <p>We were instructed to create a separate section for each topic that included both graphics and text.
                    For
                    the graphics, we were allowed to use online graphics, but we were encouraged to use original photos
                    as
                    much as possible. Each image required a caption, so if the image was unique, we had to describe it.
                    We
                    had to acknowledge the source if the image was taken from online.</p>
