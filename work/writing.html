            <h2>Tourism copy text</h2>

            <p>My first large group coding project was to create a website for a tourism agency, for which we wrote about Russia, Canada, and Germany. We coded the project for this website in Visual Studio using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>We were required to create a homepage as well as a destination. Each destination has a about, discover, and visit section. The content for the about section should include general information about the location, the discovery section should highlight cultural traditions or activities, and the visit section should detail travel options to that destination. The HTML must be valid and pass the W3C HTML/CSS validation. Using CSS media queries, the website should also be able to display on any screen type, from desktop to phone.</p>

            <h2>Chronoshift copy text</h2>

            <p>My first proper coding project was creating a website for ChronoShift, a futuristic company that traveled back in time to hunt any animal. We used HTML and CSS in Visual Studio to code the project for this website.</p>

            <p>We had to create five pages for this website. Each content page should include enough writing to fully and clearly communicate the necessary information while also including supporting images. We had to use flexbox for programming, which we had only recently learned about.</p>

            <h2>About me copy text</h2>

            <p>My first website had a 'About Me' page where I told my teachers and classmates about myself. Adobe Express was used to create the website's pages (formerly Adobe Spark). We had to design the website's homepage and about page, which included information such as family and friends, hobbies, travels, future plans, and contact information.</p>

          <p>We were instructed to create a separate section for each topic that included both graphics and text. For the graphics, we were allowed to use online graphics, but we were encouraged to use original photos as much as possible. Each image required a caption, so if the image was unique, we had to describe it. We had to acknowledge the source if the image was taken from online.</p>
