            <h2>Tourism website</h2>

            <p>My first large group coding project was to create a website for a tourism agency, for which we wrote about Russia, Canada, and Germany. We coded the project for this website in Visual Studio using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>We were required to create a homepage as well as a destination. Each destination has a about, discover, and visit section. The content for the about section should include general information about the location, the discovery section should highlight cultural traditions or activities, and the visit section should detail travel options to that destination. The HTML must be valid and pass the W3C HTML/CSS validation. Using CSS media queries, the website should also be able to display on any screen type, from desktop to phone.</p>

            <p>The most difficult parts of the project were using flexbox and adding images to the site. We found flexbox to be difficult to use and couldn't come up with any solutions, so we used it sparingly. When adding images, we would either resize or crop them, or set the image to fit within a specific width. Instead of giving up, I sought help and continued with the project. Throughout the process, I realized the value of the CART habit "perseverance."</p>

            <h2>ChronoShift website</h2>

            <p>My first proper coding project was creating a website for ChronoShift, a futuristic company that traveled back in time to hunt any animal. We used HTML and CSS in Visual Studio to code the project for this website.</p>

            <p>We had to create five pages for this website. Each content page should include enough writing to fully and clearly communicate the necessary information while also including supporting images. We had to use flexbox for programming, which we had only recently learned about.</p>

            <p>The main difficulties I encountered were when using flexbox and adding images to the site. Personally, I found flexbox to be difficult to use and couldn't think of any solutions that could help me, so I only used it sparingly. When it comes to adding images, I either resize or crop them, or I set the image to fit within a certain width. Instead of giving up, I looked for assistance and continued with the project. During the process, I realized the importance of the CART habit "initiate." As the project progressed, I learned the importance of perseverance.</p>

            <h2>About me website</h2>

            <p>My first website was a 'About Me' page that provided information about myself to my teachers and classmates. The pages for the website were created using Adobe express (formerly Adobe Spark). </p>

            <p>According to the instructions, we were to create a separate section for each topic that included both graphics and text. We were allowed to use online graphics for the graphics, but we were encouraged to use original photos as much as possible.</p>

            <p>We had to add at least one paragraph to each section to explain each image and topic; this is where I struggled the most. I've never enjoyed writing about myself or just writing in general, so I struggled when I first began to write. But I eventually got over it and completed all of my writing. I'm pleased I got over writing about myself since it's now a lot easier for me to do so. I discovered the value of the CART habit "initiate." In addition I learned the value of perseverance as I continued to write despite my thoughts about writing. </p>
